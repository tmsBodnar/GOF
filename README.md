# GOF
Game of life implemented in python
----
## The Intention
I always would like to create my own implementation of Game Of Life vellural automaton.
In the past i wrote one with java, for an interview task. You can check this out in my [other repo](https://github.com/tmsBodnar/GameOfLife)

But i wanted to write it again, when i started to discover Python
This repo is the result of my Game of Life implementation with Python

## Features
I used Tkinter to GUI
Load .lre patterns
zooming in / out the canvas
continous simulation with speed changing 
simulate step by step
