Game of life implemented in python

----

## The Intention
I always would like to create my own implementation of Game Of Life vellural automaton.
In the past i wrote one with java, for an interview task. You can check this out in my [other repo](https://github.com/tmsBodnar/GameOfLife)

But i wanted to write it again, when i started to discover Python
This repo is the result of my Game of Life implementation with Python

----

## Features
* I used Tkinter to GUI
* Load .lre patterns
* Zooming in / out the canvas
* Continous simulation with speed changing 
* Simulate step by step
